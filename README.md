# User-Defined Functions in Python

Functions are blocks of code that can be called when needed, take in arguments, and return outputs. Python has built-in functions and user-defined functions. In this module, you will learn how to create user-defined functions in Python. The module consists of a video lesson that provides an overview of the syntax and code block of user-defined functions followed by a hands-on lab that walks you through steps to define a function checksumsq(), along with tasks to check your understanding.

**Prerequisite Knowledge**: A basic understanding of data types, variables, operators, conditionals, and for loops in Python.

**Note**: This module does not cover arbitary arguments in functions.

**Estimated Time**: 12 minutes

### Recap:
In the video lesson, you learned about the syntax and code block of user-defined functions. 

1.	The `def` keyword is used at the start of the function definition.
2.	The function is given a unique name followed by parentheses and a colon. `def myfunction():`
3.	Parameters listed in the parentheses determine the number of positional and optional arguments passed into the function when it is called. `def myfunction(a,b=3):`
4.	The code block is started on a new line and is indented by 4 spaces. The code block can include
    - Variable assignments
    - Operators
    - Conditionals
    - For loops
    - Functions
    - And more.
5.	The code block is ended with the `return` keyword followed by any outputs to be stored and a semi-colon. `return â€¦ ;`
6.	To call the function once it is defined, use the name and parentheses with positional and any desired optional arguments `myfunction(2)`.

Let's now create a user-defined function in Python!

## Hands-on Lab

The following hands-on lab will walk you through creating a function that calculates and returns the sum of squares of a list of integers and checks if the sum is even or odd.
