#User-Defined Functions in Python Functions â€“ Getting Started

Functions are blocks of code that can be called when needed, take in parameters and produce outputs. Python has built-in functions and user-defined functions. In this module, we will learn how to create user-defined functions in Python. We will go over the syntax and composition of user-defined functions and practice creating a function in a hands-on lab.

Prerequisite Knowledge: A basic understanding of data types, variables, operators, conditionals, and for loops in Python.

Note: This module does not cover optional parameters in functions.
